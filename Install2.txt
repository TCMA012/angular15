npm I @angular/cli
npm install @angular/cli
npm install @angular/cli@15

	How to use angular-cli without global installation
	Using a different version of Angular
npx -p @angular/cli@15 ng new myapp

npx -p @angular/cli@12 ng new myapp12

npx 
command when you need to run a command line application inside the scope of a project. It looks inside the current project's node_modules to use the binary for that project. No globally installed packages needed.

npx ng build 
instead of 
ng build
