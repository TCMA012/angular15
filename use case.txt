Hi Aletha,
How to implement my use case in Angular?
Are there any sample codes?

My use case is user input forms.
A user has:
1. Name
First name
Last name

2. Address
Address Line 1
Address Line 2 (optional)
City
Province and Territory / State (e.g. Alberta, British Columbia, ...)
Country (Canada (appear at the top of the choices), UK, USA,  ...)
Postal Code / Zip Code


Select the Country field first from a drop down selection.
The Postal Code / Zip Code form field has input validation.
Postal codes in Canada are a six-character string consisting of three letters and three digits.
Zip codes in US are 5 digits.
The Postal Code / Zip Code are validated before calling the backend to get the Address Line 1 and 2, City, Province and Territory fields if valid; otherwise return an error

3. Telephone number 
Country code
Area code
Remaining digits

4. Email


The Name, Address, Telephone number and Email are separate screens.

The forms are to:
- register user
- edit user


Form Components will be reusable.








Create four components, name, email, phone number, address
Address: if Canada, use Canadian postal code regular expression; if US use US one
Have a next button be a link to the next component
