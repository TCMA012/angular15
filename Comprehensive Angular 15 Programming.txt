Good morning

I filled out a TCAF number 30929 for the Angular 15 sessions in September.
I will use my home computer and email for this Angular course, right?
I use my home computer. I do not use any VM.

How to access the virtual machine?
 
I couldn't find the virtual machine


this is going to need multiple monitors - is there any issue if I do this training from a personal PC?

I am using Zoom on my own machine and using RDP from my CRA machine. I didn't install anything on my CRA machine.
I am using CRA's machine for both zoom and vm, but in web browsers

I am using a personal PC.

I installed Angular 15 on one personal PC and Angular 16 on another personal PC.



In the student portal you will find a file with the instructions. The instructor should explain during the beginning of the class.


I do not a file with the instructions for virtual machine.
