I asked Aletha:
How to implement my user input forms use case in Angular?

Aletha provided some sample codes with regex for Canadian and US Postal Codes, which are good to start.

Lab 13, 14 & 15 are very good.

data.service.ts
saveBook(book: Book): Observable<any> {

I like to avoid using any if possible.
I find the solution to avoid using any.
